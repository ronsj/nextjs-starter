This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) starter template that includes:

- [TypeScript](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript)
- [Prettier](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint#prettier)
- [lint-staged](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint#lint-staged)
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
> You can use Husky to lint your commit messages, run tests, lint code, etc... when you commit or push.
- [Playwright](https://nextjs.org/docs/testing#playwright)
> Playwright is a testing framework that lets you automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API. You can use it to write End-to-End (E2E) and Integration tests across all platforms.
- [Jest & Testing Library](https://nextjs.org/docs/testing#jest-and-react-testing-library)
> Jest and React Testing Library are used together for Unit Testing.

## Setup
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --example https://github.com/ronsj/nextjs-starter-basic
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `src/pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `src/pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
